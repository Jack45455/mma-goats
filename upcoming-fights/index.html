          The biggest problem with the fight game (bar weight cutting/roids/lunacy) is that it's also the hype game. Instagram follows have nothing to do with your record; let me rephrase 
          - Instagram follows SHOULD have nothing to do with your record...

              BLOODBATH. If this actaully fuckin happens; my liver will look like a my dating life and my vocal chords - slush puppy. A technical brawler (he hates being called that
            for some dumb reason) and well... a man who has KOs at three differnt weight divisons (FW,LW,WW.) The fuck else do ya want me to say; watch it; bet on Connor, make 50G's baby.

              This fight is a joke, it will never happen. I need therapy. Kimbo Slice has a better chance of fighting Chuck Liddell then this happening. I think tony would elbow him 
              into Dagestan; whilst probably inventing a Martail Art mid fight - Tony's mad and would win beacuse of this.

              The MMA Gods have blessed us with this blood stained knife fight. I'm exited. If Tony does not slice him open, someones gettin it, the ref/himself - whatever dudes a killer.
              Then ya got the most violent man there has ever been ever. Gaethje actually enjoys getting hit, as DC says "you fall in love with being able to hurt them." I think this is also
              applicable huh. Look this is gonna be fuckin mental, lets just hope no one for real dies. This fight is a fuckin Wu-Tang song. This fight is a coked up knife fight, with bears.
              This fight is WW3 in an octagon. This fight is why my wrists are in tact. This fight is fuckin nuts...

              I don't know if you've seen Edward Norton Hulk fight other Hulk in that film called The Hulk; but this is that via Martail Arts in a cage. Both have crazy power, I'm hopeing for
              another Ngannou decapitation like with Overeem. Or whatever, at the very least it won't be like that bullshit Derik Lewis fight. Hopefully...
