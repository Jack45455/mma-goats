        Widely considered to be one of the most dominent kickboxers ever, bar a few losses. A seemless transition the MMA and remains underfeated in the UFC
        and still a young man.
        Proud of his heritige and rightly so, he carries the will of a true warrior with every strike. 
        In the midst of the all out war against Kevin Gastulum, he famously excalimed 
        that he is prepared to die to win, this gave him the confidence to battle on and be crowned the victor. His closest fight yet, then with pure diligence; 
        he managed to take the middlewight title. - Not taking anything away but... Whittaker defo had an injured ankle, like Mcgregor against Khabib Nurmagomedov!

      about what loss you misinterpret as evidence. The way he "disregarded the striking
