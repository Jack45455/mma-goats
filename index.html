        He's 5"10, he throws people 6"5 across the octagon and proceeds to slam them on thier heads! Hardly get taken down, amazin on the ground regardless,
        even better on the feet. A great LH and a more powerful HW, taken the title from, arguably the best HW of all time; in Stipe Miocic. An overhand that sends you to space, 
        you better have superfluous head movement/footwork or you are going to experience a true martial artist at work.

        Widely considered to be one of the most dominent kickboxers ever, bar a few losses. A seemless transition the MMA and remains underfeated in the UFC
        and still a young man.
        Proud of his heritige and rightly so, he carries the will of a true warrior with every strike. 
        In the midst of the all out war against Kevin Gastulum, he famously excalimed 
        that he is prepared to die to win, this gave him the confidence to battle on and be crowned the victor. His closest fight yet, then with pure diligence; 
        he managed to take the middlewight title. - Not taking anything away but... Whittaker defo had an injured ankle, like Mcgregor against Khabib Nurmagomedov!
        All good...

        An OG. One of the first UFC to be known outside the octagon, which in my opinion; massivly overshadowed his intrinsic ability. Famously rivaled and beat Tito 
        "roided up twat" Ortiz, he climed the ranks and justly entered the UFC hall of fame and should be for all of MMA.

        UFC was created to test which Martial Art combination is king. Brazilain Ju Jitsu and Muay Thai is that answer. UFC 1 Gracie shocked the world, as a smaller man
        chocked the fuck out of roided up wrestling brawlers. Famously drew, then performed a rear naked chocke to the legend that is Ken Shamrock. We owe these fighters a debt
        of gratitude and respect.
