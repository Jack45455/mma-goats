              It's a good rematch. Evident in the progress of both fighters espsically Connor, there were definitly both better as a result of the first fight.
              To state the obvious; Mcgregor took that fight with limited time to prepare and his cardio/weight was not achived, unlike the 2nd. And agian, Connor clearly had bad cadio,
              which is part of the reason why Nate choked him. So; the next fight. Now the weight is fair, also even though there is a slight drop in Connor's speed, i don't see how that's 
              evidence to stay at lightweight, he said that's what he normally weighs naturally . So there's blood spilt on the floor of the octogan - not weird for Diaz fight.
              Commentators are definitly bias. Nate dropped multible times but displayed his zombie chin to keep getiing back up and catching Connor out a few times when McGregor 
              was trying to catch his breath. For me, a clear victory for the mad irishman; the same goes for Nate in the first fight. I agreed with the result, but whatever if ya don't - don't try and talk about this if you disagree. Despite all the shit talking, it was a good MMA fight - not the brawl 
              some people expected, like it proberly would be with a fighter like Justin Gaethje.

              Yeah I like rematches, GSP revenge to DC doing well until that soul crushing head kick. Fuck Jones man; go attempt to kill another pregnent women on coke and roids,
              you genetically privallaged cunt! Anyway, Yoel at the young age of 57 and Robert "dont give a fuck if I'm injured" Whittaker, basically the Eminem of MMA. Actually; 
              it's probably Connor, lets be real. So... the fight. Yeah; it could have gone either way, even the first bout. But whats important is was the momentus heart and grit, 
              again shown in both fights. Yoel has been robbed in 5 fuckin fights and hopefully he will do damage in the Isreal fight, but thats for another day. So... two warriors
              battle it out in the octagon and you're gonna sit there with dorrito dust on your chubby fuckin fingers and complain. No. Respect is missing in modern day MMA, ironically 
              and it has nothing to do with insane Irish shit talking. Mental warefare carries gravitas, just ask Jose Aldo. Any fuckin way, both fights were great and I think I speak for
              all the fans, when express interest in a trilogy to settle this, much like Nate and Connor or maybe even Jones and DC at HW but I'm not sure if i can watch DC lose again. 
              Yoel and Whittaker are legends and deserve respect, they were great fuckin fights. Enough said...

              Yeah i know; another Yoel bloodbath. Cmon, how could I not mention this absolute fuckin war. Besides a brutal knee to the shaft and a few well deserved eye pokes, this 
              was as advertised; fuckin mental. The fuck else do you want; if you have not seen it.... do!

              Alexander-Gustafsson won 3 rounds of 5. He fuckin won. Fight me about it. Even Jones admitted he is his toughest opponent, he was hospitiliesed and was broken by severe pain.
              LOL. He is the only MMA fighter to take Jones down, he defended something like 9 takedowns from Jones the "incredible wrestler!" So Jones was: out-wrestled, out-boxed and 
              in my opinion, laughably outclassed and subsequently given a undeserved hand raise as Dana gave him Gustaffson's belt. Look Jones is an incredible fighter, I ain't here
              to kiss ass, but he got fucked up and I'm sick of everyone looking past that giant sweedish fuckin lunatic.

              Is this the most fuckin dominent title fight either in the lightweight division or ever!? I dont know about any of that meaningless bullshit; but all I know this was a joy to watch, 
              taking away my Irish heritige. Not just the final one, but the combos, the kicks and of course unlike poor Eddie; you knew that left hand was literlly and proverbially 
              landing like a fuckin Boeing 747. Surprise Surprise; the overused irony is back for no apparent reason motherfuckersssss...
