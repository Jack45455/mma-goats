          Hands down one of the most important fights in not just the UFC but in all of MMA. Evident in the progress of both fighters (espsically Connor) from the the first fight.
          To state the obvious; Mcgregor took that fight at a moments notice and his cardio/weight was not achived to the standerd of neccesity. S agian, Connor clearly gassed out 
          and left his throat for the taking. Nate took it. So; the next fight. We find the same fighters much more confident, fitter and much more muscle mass. This colminated in a 
          collosal amount of earnt blood spilt on the floor of the octogan. Fans on their feet. Commentators exclaiming with awe and adreninline. Nate dropped multible times but 
          displayed his chin and heart to keep getiing back up and catching Connor out a few times when Mcgegor was trying to catch his breathe. For me, a clear victory for the 
          mad irishman; the same goes for Nate in the first fight. To top it off, when the bell rung through the stadium, both fighters relieved to sheathe their proverbial swords 
          anticipating the clear result. As the photo above conveys, a pillar of Martail Arts. Respect. Despite all the shit talking, game finally deservidly recognised game. 
          Connors hand raised... leaving fans clawing for the trilogy to eventaully settle this drawn out bullshit. In short; I fuckin love this fight and massivly regret not 
          placing money on my prediction. Fuck...

          Yeah I like rematches, GSP revenge to DC doing well until that soul crushing head kick. Fuck Jones man; go attempt to kill another pregnent women on coke and roids,
          you genetically privallaged cunt! Anyway, Yoel at the young age of 57 and Robert "dont give a fuck if I'm injured" Whittaker, basically the Eminem of MMA. Actually; 
          it's probably Connor, lets be real. So... the fight. Yeah; it could have gone either way, even the first bout. But whats important is was the momentus heart and grit, 
          again shown in both fights. Yoel has been robbed in 5 fuckin fights and hopefully he will do damage in the Isreal fight, but thats for another day. So... two warriors
          battle it out in the octagon and you're gonna sit there with dorrito dust on your chubby fuckin fingers and complain. No. Respect is missing in modern day MMA, ironically 
          and it has nothing to do with insane Irish shit talking. Mental warefare carries gravitas, just ask Jose Aldo. Any fuckin way, both fights were great and I think I speak for
          all the fans, when express interest in a trilogy to settle this, much like Nate and Connor or maybe even Jones and DC at HW but I'm not sure if i can watch DC lose again. 
          Yoel and Whittaker are legends and deserve respect, they were great fuckin fights. Enough said...

          Yeah i know; another fuckin Yoel bloodbath. Cmon, how could I not mention this absolute fuckin war. Besides a brutal knee to the shaft and a few well deserved eye pokes, this 
          was as advertised; fuckin mental. What the fuck else do you want me to say; if you have not seen it.... do!

          Alexander-Gustafsson won 3 rounds of 5. He fuckin won. Fight me about it. Even Jones admitted he is his toughest opponent, he was hospitiliesed and was broken by severe pain.
          LOL. He is the only MMA fighter to take Jones down, he defended something like 9 takedowns from Jones the "incredible wrestler!" So Jones was: out-wrestled, out-boxed and 
          in my opinion, laughably outclassed and subsequently given a undeserved hand raise as Dana gave him Gustaffson's belt. Look Jones is an incredible fighter, I ain't here
          to kiss ass, but he got fucked up and I'm sick of everyone looking past that giant sweedish fuckin lunatic.

          Is this the most fuckin dominent title fight either in the lightweight division or ever!? I dont know about any of that meaningless bullshit; but all I know this was a joy to watch, 
          taking away my Irish heritige. Not just the final one, but the combos, the kicks and of course unlike poor Eddie; you knew that left hand was literlly and proverbially 
          landing like a fuckin Boeing 747. Surprise Surprise; the overused irony is back for no apparent reason motherfuckersssss...
